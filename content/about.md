title: "about.me"

I am a Linguistics PhD student at UCSC. This is my records of pixels and photons.

My longstanding project is "One Photo One Day." which started as a part of my 2024 new year resolution. The objective was (and is) simple: Take at least one photo everyday and select one.

These are the highs (and lows) of my everyday photographs.
